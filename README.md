# INR LOG 🩸🎮

## About This Project 🌟
**INR LOG** is a heartfelt and innovative project designed for the Playdate Console. It stems from a personal need to manage health concerns more effectively, particularly for individuals on blood thinners. The inspiration for this project comes from my own experiences with managing my International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels. 

🎯 **Primary Goal:** To create a handy tool for individuals to monitor their INR levels more frequently and effectively. This is crucial for those of us on blood thinners, as regular monitoring can significantly impact our health and lifestyle.

🏡 **Secondary Goal:** Utilizing the periods when outdoor activities are restricted (due to health precautions like overly thin blood) as an opportunity to engage in a creative and constructive endeavor. Building **INR LOG** not only serves a practical purpose but also transforms challenging times into periods of productivity and innovation.
